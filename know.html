        <h1>One Hot PREPS</h1>
<pre>    <strong>It was a joyful evening when an Examiner was teaching the whole class 
        on how to solve BECE question. it was sooo boring which made some of the boys decided to exit the class and eat at the canteen.
     There came this girl called Martha who came the to let Mensah and his friends to activate her Breast and Nyash for her.
    It went too far and she started screaming for help which made Sir Stephen to come out and storm us. she run away and was left 
    with the boys at the back of the school. we couldn't run or hide our face but there this 2 Boys call Kelvin Ali and Michael Asiamah who had the balls
    to jump the wall and 22 boys followed them and also jumped the wall which made sir to vex but George went to hide   
    himself at the back of the kenkey sellers fire wood. Now we were all wanted in the school and our only option was
    to come back when its prep over. we entered the class we all kept quiet and pretend nothing happend.
