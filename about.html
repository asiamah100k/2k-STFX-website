                    <p>
                        The name that brings a smile to our faces! Our class entertainer, Jordan, had a gift for making us laugh, 
                        even on our most stressful days. His quick wit, silly jokes, 
                        and hilarious impressions could turn any boring lecture into a comedy show.
                        George, you may have been the class clown, but to us, you're so much more. 
                        You're a reminder that laughter and joy can be found even in the most unexpected places. 
                        Thanks for being our sunshine, Jordan!".
